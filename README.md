# TIC-TAC-TOE THAT NEVER LOSES

**The following project is an implement of a tic-tac-toe algoritm that never takes a lose.**

If you think you can beat it, try it out:

**[play here](https://theperas.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe_Algoritm/)**

## Algoritm
The algoritm was taken in the book of Pedro Domingos, "The Master Algorithm" and it's the following on

> 1. If you or your opponent has two in a row, play on the remaining square.
> 2. Otherwise, if there’s a move that creates two lines of two in a row, play that.
> 3. Otherwise, if the center square is free, play there.
> 4. Otherwise, if your opponent has played in a corner, play in the opposite corner.
> 5. Otherwise, if there’s an empty corner, play there. 
> 6. Otherwise, play on any empty square.

If you don't know anything about artificial intelligence and want to know a litle beat I really recommend you the book.

## Game
This implement is build on top of a tic-tac-toe project made by [Borna Šepić](https://github.com/BornaSepic). That means the mecanism of the game is built by him, and was forked by his [Tic-Tac-Toe repo](https://github.com/BornaSepic/Tic-Tac-Toe)

## My role
I have costumized the Borna aproach and gave it a little of my taste. So the user can choose being the first or second to play.
